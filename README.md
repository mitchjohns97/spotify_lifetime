Go to https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/ and download Extended Streaming History. This can take up to 30 days to prepare.

To use an existing streaming history and access the api cache, go here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t1Aotyxb5GpyMs9yItHTAGcvHPQ2as3H?usp=sharing.

Save streaming history in a folder called 'rd'. Save libraries in a folder called 'cache'.

Feel free to message me for api id and secret.
